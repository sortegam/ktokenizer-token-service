# TODO

[ ] A way to split up serverless.yml (Splitting up serverless.yml into multiple files breaks configuration.)
[ ] Updating of serverless-dynamodb-local package fails > 0.2.30 (has a bug)
[ ] Updating of serverless-doyenv-plugin package fails > 1.1.5 (has a bug)
[ ] Improve unit testing for (detokenizer, tokenizer, kmsEncryption, operations)
[ ] Take care with malformed JSON at POST requests. Sometimes throws an HTML with some trace info.
[ ] Make DB Delete Policy to Retain if PROD / STG (in current case) and Delete if other stages.
[ ] ESLINT complaining about the optional chaining (?)

# --- DEPLOY TASKS

[ ] Add CanGetOperations permission to prod DATABASE
[ ] DEBUG_KEY env variable is not needed anymore
[ ] Added KTOKENIZER_LOG_LEVEL env variable

# --- Where I left
